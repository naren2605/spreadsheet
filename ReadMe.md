Spreadsheet use cases:
- proj.redmart.execute.Main#main contains the excutable code 
- proj.redmart.integrationTests.LayoutVistitorTest has tests which covers cell evaluation and cyclic dependency

Considerations:
 - only simple post fix evaluation is used for cell formula which suports  + - / *  operators
